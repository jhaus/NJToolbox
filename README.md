# NJToolbox

A repository for data, tools, and code that may be useful when working with New Jersey data.

Pull requests encouraged.

## Contents

### /landuse

Data and code to make working with NJ Land Use data easier. 

Source data in ESRI shapefile and FGDB formats can be found at [NJ DEP Bureau of GIS](http://nj.gov/dep/gis/).

Most of the code here relies on [GDAL/OGR](http://gdal.org) and [PostGIS](http://postgis.org). As such, these tools will help you work with the Land Use data without ESRI ArcGIS and on non-Microsoft operating systems.

View the README within for more information.

### /data

Data or code for general-purpose analysis or mapping.
